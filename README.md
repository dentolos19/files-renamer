A collection of scripts for renaming and organizing files easily!

## ⚒️ Usage

If you just want to setup the development environment, you can run `setup.bat` which automatically creates a Python virtual environment and installs all required dependencies.

### Prerequities

- [Python](https://python.org) 3.10+

### Instructions

1. Select the files that you want to rename
2. Drag them into the batch script that you want to use
    - `rename-randomly.bat`: Like the name says, it renames files randomly.
    - `rename-by-date.bat`: It renames the files accordingly. In order, date taken (if the file is an image/video), date modified and then date created.
3. Happy renaming!
