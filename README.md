A collection of scripts for renaming and organizing files easily! This is made for personal use.

## ‚öíÔ∏è Usage

If you just want to setup the development environment, you can run `setup.bat` which automatically creates a Python virtual environment and installs all required dependencies. Make sure you have Python 3.10+ installed on your computer.

### Tools

- `rename-randomly.bat`: Like the name says, it renames files randomly. This is configurable.
- `rename-by-date.bat`: It renames the files accordingly. In order, date taken (if the file is an image/video), date modified and then date created.

### Instructions

1. Select the files that you want to rename
2. Drag them into the batch script that you want to use (see above for information)
3. Done!
